SSL Certificate Monitor
Overview
This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed to monitor SSL certificate expiry dates for domains. The application provides a simple API endpoint to check SSL certificate status, including expiry dates and days remaining until expiration.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Backend Architecture
Framework: Flask (Python web framework)
Language: Python
Architecture Pattern: Simple API service with direct SSL certificate checking
Error Handling: Comprehensive SSL error handling with specific error categorization
Core Functionality
The application implements SSL certificate monitoring through direct socket connections to target domains on port 443. It extracts certificate information and calculates expiry metrics in real-time.

Key Components
SSL Certificate Checker (get_cert_expiry function)
Purpose: Core business logic for SSL certificate validation
Functionality:
Establishes secure SSL connections to target domains
Extracts certificate expiry information
Calculates days remaining until expiration
Handles various SSL error scenarios
Timeout: 5-second connection timeout for reliability
Return Format: JSON structure with domain, status, expiry date, and days remaining
Flask Web Application
Framework: Flask with JSON API endpoints
Logging: Debug-level logging enabled for troubleshooting
Response Format: JSON responses for programmatic consumption
Data Flow
Request Reception: Flask receives HTTP requests for certificate checking
Domain Processing: Target domain extracted from request parameters
SSL Connection: Direct socket connection established to domain:443
Certificate Extraction: SSL certificate information retrieved and parsed
Expiry Calculation: Days remaining calculated using UTC timezone
Response Generation: JSON response with certificate status and metrics
External Dependencies
Core Dependencies
ssl: Python standard library for SSL/TLS operations
socket: Python standard library for network connections
datetime: Python standard library for date/time operations
Flask: Web framework for API endpoints
logging: Python standard library for application logging
Network Requirements
Outbound HTTPS connectivity (port 443) to target domains
SSL/TLS certificate validation capabilities
Deployment Strategy
Current State
The application appears to be in development with incomplete error handling implementation. The get_cert_expiry function contains an unfinished exception handler for SSL errors.

Recommended Deployment Approach
Environment: Suitable for containerized deployment (Docker)
Scaling: Stateless design allows for horizontal scaling
Monitoring: Debug logging configured for operational visibility
Security: Uses secure SSL contexts with default certificate validation
Development Considerations
Complete the SSL error handling implementation
Add input validation for domain parameters
Implement rate limiting for production use
Add health check endpoints
Consider adding persistent storage for historical certificate data
Notes
The codebase is currently incomplete, with an unfinished SSL error handling block that needs completion. The application follows a simple, direct approach to certificate checking without caching or persistence layers, making it suitable for real-time certificate monitoring scenarios.
